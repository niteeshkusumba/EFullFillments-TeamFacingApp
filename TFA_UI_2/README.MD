The Yale University Library, as one of the world's leading research libraries, collects, organizes, preserves, and provides access to and services for a rich and unique record of human thought and creativity. Through its web sites, the Library offers public access to a range of its collections through online exhibitions, archival finding aids, digital image repositories, and the online public access catalog.

Whenever possible, the Library provides factual information about copyright owners and related matters in catalog records, finding aids, and other texts that accompany collections or individual items. In many cases the Library may not hold copyright over items in the collections, nor images displayed online. Permission to use images and possible fees may be required by the copyright owner independently of the Library. It is the researcher's obligation to determine and satisfy copyright or other use restrictions when publishing or otherwise distributing materials found in the Library's collections. Transmission or reproduction of protected items beyond that allowed by fair use requires the permission of the copyright owners. Researchers must make their own assessments of rights in light of their intended use.

Yale University Library wants to hear from any copyright owners who are not properly identified on this or any other Yale University Library web site so that we may make the necessary corrections. Please write to atYUL@yale.edu with your contact information and a link to the relevant content.
